###Criteria
```
There is a weather dashboard with form inputs. 
You are able to serach for a city and are presented with conditions for that city and that city is then added to a search history.
The data that is shown is the city name, today's current date, an icon representing the weather, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index. 
The UV index is also color coded to show if the conditions favorable, moderate, or severe. 
The weather dashboard also displays a 5 day forecast that displays the date, and icon of the future weather conditions, the temperature and humidity. 
The search history is a clickable function where the current and forecast are shown. 
When you reopen the weather dashboard, you are able to to view the last cities forecast.

###What was used
